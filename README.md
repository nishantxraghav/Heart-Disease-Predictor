# Heart Disease Prediction (Machine Learning)

This project predicts whether a person is likely to have heart disease using supervised machine learning techniques.  
It focuses on data analysis, visualization, model training, and evaluation using a medical dataset.

## Dataset Description

The dataset contains medical attributes related to heart health, including:

- Age  
- Sex  
- Chest pain type  
- Resting blood pressure  
- Cholesterol level  
- Fasting blood sugar  
- Maximum heart rate  
- Exercise-induced angina  
- ST depression  
- Target variable (Heart Disease)

Target values:
- 1 → Heart disease present  
- 0 → No heart disease

## Tools and Libraries Used

- Python  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- NumPy  
- Pandas  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  
- Scikit-learn

## Machine Learning Workflow

1. Load and inspect the dataset  
2. Perform data cleaning and preprocessing  
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
4. Feature selection  
5. Train the machine learning model  
6. Evaluate model performance  

---

## Model Performance

- The trained model shows good prediction accuracy on test data  
- Performance is evaluated using accuracy score and confusion matrix  

---

## How to Run the Project

1. Clone the repository  
2. Open Jupyter Notebook  
3. Run the file `Heart Disease Predictions.ipynb`  

---

## Future Improvements

- Try advanced models (Random Forest, SVM, XGBoost)  
- Perform hyperparameter tuning  
- Convert the notebook into a web application  
- Add explainable AI techniques (SHAP / LIME)
